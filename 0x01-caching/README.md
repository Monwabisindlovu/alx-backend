# 0x01. Caching

## Description

This project explores different caching algorithms implemented in Python.

### Tasks

1. Basic dictionary
2. FIFO caching
3. LIFO caching
4. LRU caching
5. MRU caching
6. LFU caching

## Requirements

- Python Scripts:
  - All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.7)
  - All your files should end with a new line
  - The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
  - A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
  - Your code should use the `pycodestyle` style (version 2.5)
  - All your files must be executable
  - The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
  - All your modules should have documentation
  - All your classes should have documentation
  - All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation
  - A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class, or method (the length of it will be verified)

## Usage

To test each caching algorithm, you can run the respective main Python file. For example:

```bash
./0-main.py
./1-main.py
# etc.
